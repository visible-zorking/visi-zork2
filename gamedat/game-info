# Maps game file indexes to ZIL source code names.
# Also some other kinds of info.
#
# This information was compiled manually; there is no simple way to
# extract it from the source and game file. (Everything that could
# be extracted automatically is handled by pyana. Which loads this info
# to orient itself.)
#
# Much of this work was done by Allen Garvin et al in 2007:
#   https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/tools/reform/
# However, they didn't have the source code names, so I have done
# additional work in matching up to the ZIL code.

# Functions (high memory): $4B72 / 19314
# Strings (high memory): $11AB2 / 72370

# Source files in presentation order. The second number is the order that
# code is generated in the game file. (Which is *not* the same order that
# the files are included!)
