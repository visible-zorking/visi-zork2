# Maps game file indexes to ZIL source code names.
# Also some other kinds of info.
#
# This information was compiled manually; there is no simple way to
# extract it from the source and game file. (Everything that could
# be extracted automatically is handled by pyana. Which loads this info
# to orient itself.)
#
# Much of this work was done by Allen Garvin et al in 2007:
#   https://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archive/infocom/tools/reform/
# However, they didn't have the source code names, so I have done
# additional work in matching up to the ZIL code.
