ABOUT: Welcome to the commentary track!

const:ZORK-NUMBER: The number of the Zorks shall be two.
	(“Three, sir!”)
	Yes, but *this* one is Zork 2.

rtn:V-VERSION: Print the title, release, and serial number.
	This function is shared between all three Zorks, which is why it has code to print all three titles. The passages meant for Zork 1 and 3 were ignored when compiling Zork 2. (Skipped code is shown in grey.)

src:GVERBS-89: The TRS-80 interpreter set a special bit which told the game to change certain behavior for no-doubt-contractual reasons. For Zork 2, it adds the line “Licensed to Tandy Corporation”.
	For a complete list of “Tandy bit” behavior changes in Infocom games, [see this page|https://ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/info/tandy_bits.html].

objtree-legend: In this list, `Rooms` are rooms and `Items` are regular items. (Sometimes portable, sometimes not.)
	`Scen` indicates scenery objects. These exist in multiple places; for example, the [~obj:MOSS] is visible from many locations near the entrance.
	`Glob` indicates a global object, which is *always* visible, or at least mentionable. For example, [~obj:GRUE] is global – not because grues are always present, but so you can always ask `WHAT IS A GRUE`.

obj:LOCAL-GLOBALS: This is a container for scenery objects like [~obj:MOSS], which are visible from many locations in the game.

src:GGLOBALS-26: This refers to the word `ZZMGCK` in [~obj:LOCAL-GLOBALS], above.
	Why is this synonym necessary? Does it need to be alphabetically last? Not clear! Most Infocom games have it (or a variation), but some say “No, this synonym doesn’t need to exist” instead.
	If you type `EXAMINE ZZMGCK`, the parser finds [~obj:local-globals]. But that object is nameless, so you get a garbage reply. Go on, try it.

obj:ADVENTURER: Yes, the player’s printed name is “cretin”, although the game rarely says so. (The death message for `ATTACK HEADS` mentions it.) This sort of sarcastic insult hasn’t aged too well, but MIT culture had a lot of it. Compare [*glob:WINNER], and also the old MIT [Jargon File|https://jargon-file.org/archive/jargon-1.0.0.33.dos.txt].
	Note that if you refer to `ME` (or `CRETIN`), you get the [*obj:ME] global object, not the `ADVENTURER`.

obj:ME: A global object which is always in scope. Commands referring to `ME` hit this, rather than [*obj:ADVENTURER], which is a stub that moves around the map.
	Because of this, parser messages mostly refer to you as “you”, even though the [*obj:ADVENTURER]’s printed name is “cretin”.

glob:PLAYER: `PLAYER` is always the [~obj:ADVENTURER]. Compare [*glob:WINNER].

glob:WINNER: `WINNER` is the actor in the current command. (Compare [*glob:PLAYER].) 
	`WINNER` is usually [~obj:ADVENTURER], but for a command like `ROBOT, GO EAST` it shifts to the named NPC.
	“Winner” is just as sarcastic as “[cretin|*obj:ADVENTURER]”, but from the other side.

glob:HERE: The location of the [*glob:WINNER].
